                        <p>Disruptive behavior doesn’t have to be this dramatic, like a movie scene you’d watch in a media literacy lesson, but poor classroom management will almost assuredly elevate your stress and burnout rates.

<br> Make a habit of demonstrating behavior you want to see, as many studies show that modelling effectively teaches students how to act in different situations.

<p>A straightforward way to model certain behaviors is holding a mock conversation with an administrator, other teacher or student helper in front of the class. Talking about a test or other relatable topic, be sure to:</p>

    <br>•Use polite language
    <br>•Maintain eye contact
    <br>•Keep phones in your pockets
    <br>•Let one another speak uninterrupted
    <br>•Raise concerns about one another’s statements in a respectful manner
    <br>•After, start a class discussion to list and expand upon the ideal behaviors you exemplified.<br>
